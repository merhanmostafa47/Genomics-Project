## Project idea

- Annotating an assembled sequence (obtained from NCBI) of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria  
 to identify protein encoding segments using **ORFfinder** 

- Then compare it with all sequences of the same organism to know the similarity percent between them and   
the real name of the proteins they make up.
